# Contributing Guidelines

## Adding or improving a tool

To add a new tool, please follow the [classical way of contributing through GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork):

1. Create a fork of this repository (or update your existing one)
2. Add your changes:

  * In case of a new tool, please copy [`_template`](_template/) directory and adjust its README file; then place the tool (source codes and other relevant files there).
  * In case of existing tool, simply work on it

3. Create a Pull Request to the upstream repository.
4. Describe briefly what have you done and why in the PR message.
5. Follow up the discussion.

To maintain good practice:

* Use English in your codes and write it understandable.
* Use comments where necessary.
* Use some code prettifier / code formatter to maintain nice code style.

## Reporting an issue

When reporting an issue with a tool, please mention clearly what tool you used (from which specific commit) and how.
